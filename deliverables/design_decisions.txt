Part 3

Decision 1: Fact table Grain 
-Option A: One row per encounter 
I chose One row per encounter because all the 4 business questions worked on so far 
anchor on encounters. So each business question posed about the database just  has to do with 
an encounter of a patient to the hospital facility. So the grain is One patient encounter, that is 
One row per encounter 


Decision 2:Dimension Tables 

| Dimension          | Attributes                                     |
| ------------------ | ---------------------------------------------- |
| dim_date           | date_key, calendar_date, year, month, quarter  |
| dim_patient        | patient_key, patient_id, gender, age_group     |
| dim_provider       | provider_key, provider_id, full_name           |
| dim_specialty      | specialty_key, specialty_id, specialty_name    |
| dim_department     | department_key, department_id, department_name |
| dim_encounter_type | encounter_type_key, type_name                  |
| dim_diagnosis      | diagnosis_key, icd10_code, description         |
| dim_procedure      | procedure_key, cpt_code, description           |



Decision 3:
fact_encounters:
-encounter_count
-procedure_count
-total_allowed_amount
-total_claim_amount
-diagnosis_count
- procedure_count
-length_of_stay


Pre-aggregating these metrics helps in avoiding writing of complex joins in queries or multiples joins
and it helps in writing a faster group by

Part 3 
3.1 
Decision 1: Fact table Grain 
-Option A: One row per encounter 
I chose One row per encounter because all the 4 business questions worked on so far 
anchor on encounters. So each business question posed about the database just  has to do with 
an encounter of a patient to the hospital facility. So the grain is One patient encounter, that is 
One row per encounter 


Decision 2:Dimension Tables 

| Dimension          | Attributes                                     
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
| dim_date           | date_key, calendar_date, year, month, quarter  
| dim_patient        | patient_key, patient_id, gender, age_group,full_name(first_name+last_name),mrn  
| dim_provider       | provider_key, provider_id, full_name(first_name+last_name),specialty_id,department_id          
| dim_specialty      | specialty_key, specialty_id, specialty_name    
| dim_department     | department_key, department_id, department_name
| dim_encounter_type | encounter_type_key, type_name                  
| dim_diagnosis      | diagnosis_key, icd10_code, description         
| dim_procedure      | procedure_key, cpt_code, description           



Decision 3:
fact_encounters:
- encounter_count
- procedure_count
- total_allowed_amount
- total_claim_amount
- diagnosis_count
- procedure_count
- length_of_stay


Pre-aggregating these metrics helps in avoiding writing of complex joins in queries or multiples joins
and it helps in writing a faster group by. Metrics are able to be reuse across the queries.


Decision 4: Bridges Tables 
Yes, I made use of bridges table 
- encounter <-> diagnoses 
- encounter <-> procedures 

This is because they are have many to many relationship and not forming a bridge relationship out of them will 
result in row explosion when queried
